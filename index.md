Welcome to learn how to use Docker containers as a working environment during the 2024 CMS Open Data Workshop. Containers are the most reproducible way to give all participants the same working environment, and will be used in all the interactive lessons of this workshop.

In this lesson, you will be asked to download the containers that will facilitate your work on CMS Open Data, and learn the basics of their use. 
This is not a full introduction to Docker, however, we do take time to explain some key concepts that should make your experience a smooth one.
